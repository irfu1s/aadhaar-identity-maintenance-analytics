the transition from enrolment-driven growth to maintenance-driven operations.

## Key Insights

- ~88% of operational load comes from demographic updates
- Adult populations drive system stress; youth drive enrolment growth
- Maintenance pressure is uneven across states

## Tools & Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Power BI
- Public UIDAI / data.gov.in datasets

## Disclaimer
This project uses only publicly available, aggregated datasets.
No personal or sensitive Aadhaar data is included.
